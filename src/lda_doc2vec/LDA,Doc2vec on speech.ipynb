      "Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Bank supervision in a world economy  At the International Conference of Banking Supervisors, Stockholm, Sweden  June 13, 1996I am honored to present the William Taylor Memorial       Lecture to such a distinguished group of senior bank supervisors       from around the world.  I am especially delighted to have with us       Bill's wife, Sharon, and daughter, Claire.  This visit gives them       the opportunity to meet more of Bill's colleagues and to       appreciate, once again, the great importance of the work he did.Those of you who had the opportunity to know Bill can       recall him as a dedicated bank supervisor and an outstanding       public servant.  We in the United States were certainly fortunate       to have had him lead our bank supervisory functions at the       Federal Reserve and the FDIC while the U.S. banking system was       experiencing quite difficult times.  To me, no individual       displayed the characteristics necessary for a successful senior       bank supervisor better than Bill Taylor.  Well known for this       integrity, tenacity, and professional dedication, Bill demanded       the best from himself and from those around him.  He understood       that a safe and sound banking system was essential to a healthy       market system, and he was committed to maintaining such a system.His contributions extended outside the United States       and into the efforts of the Basle Committee on Banking       Supervision and beyond.  Indeed, he--as much as anyone--       recognized that the changes occurring in our international       banking system increased the importance of supervisors from       around the world communicating and working together.  It is most       fitting, therefore, that we remember him at this conference.A Period of Change                  The dual themes of this year's conference of cross-       border banking and qualitative supervision are highly relevant to       our responsibilities as bank supervisors in a world economy that       is becoming increasingly integrated and complex.  Banking has       become more sophisticated; the volume of transactions has       multiplied; and competitive pressures have grown.  These       developments reflect the increased efficiency of financial       markets worldwide, which have helped to bring about expanded       international trade and economic growth.However, by strengthening the interdependencies among       markets and market participants, they may also have increased the       potential for significant, adverse events to spread quickly to       other markets.  As bank supervisors, we must deal with both the       positive and the potentially negative effects of rapid innovation       and change.  We should also take the opportunity that change       provides to promote sound risk management practices within our       banking systems.  Meeting these challenges will be a daunting       task.During my comments this evening I will suggest ways       supervisors can address these challenges and prepare for       undoubtedly greater changes in the years to come.  First, though,       I would like to discuss the interaction of governments and       central banks with private commercial banks in free economies in       terms of risk sharing.  By articulating and understanding that       relationship, we may have a better framework for considering how       to supervise and regulate our financial institutions.A Leveraged Banking System          In addressing these issues it is important to remember       that many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive       from their willingness to take risks and from their use of a       relatively high degree of financial leverage.  Through leverage,       in the form principally of taking deposits, banks perform a       critical role in the financial intermediation process, providing       savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a       greater range of sources of credit, thereby facilitating a more       efficient allocation of resources and contributing importantly to       greater economic growth.  Indeed, it was the evident value of       intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of       our financial systems from the earliest times--certainly since       Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited gold       was feasible and profitable.  Stockholm, itself, recognized the       value of intermediation with the founding of the Riksbank more       than 300 years ago as a private institution.Of course, this same leverage and risk-taking also       greatly increases the possibility of bank failure.  Indeed,       without leverage, losses from risk-taking would be absorbed by       the bank's owners, virtually eliminating the chance that the bank       would be unable to meet its obligations in a \"failure\".  Some       failures can be of a bank's own making, resulting, for example,       from poor credit judgements.  For the most part, these failures       are a normal and important part of the market process and provide       discipline and information to other participants regarding the       level of business risks.  Other failures, can result from, and       contribute to, the rare episodes of severe economic or market       turmoil that affects broad segments of an economy and is not the       consequence of the imprudence of individual banks.  Because of       important roles banks and other financial intermediaries play in       our financial systems, such failures could have large ripple       effects that spread throughout business and financial markets at       great costs.The Distribution of Risks         Over time, societies concluded that leverage and       intermediation were essential to economic performance, but also       that some bank failures could have unacceptable economic costs.       In response, central banks were created and were accorded new       responsibilities, and what we now call prudential regulation       evolved.  In the United States, these initiatives took the shape       of the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 after several       financial panics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and       of federal deposit insurance and a broadened role for bank       supervisors in the 1930's.  While the responses in other       countries were often less overt, they were generally still       significant in their effects.This expanded role of governments, central banks, and       bank supervisors implies a complex approach to managing and even       sharing the risks of failure between governments and privately       owned banks.  Some of what central banks do might be termed       \"shaping\" or reducing some kinds of risks, primarily by providing       liquidity in certain situations to reduce the odds of extreme       market outcomes, in which uncertainty feeds market panics.       Traditionally this was accomplished by making discount or Lombard       facilities available, so that depositories could turn illiquid       assets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled market       conditions by selling such assets or calling loans.  Similarly,       open market operations, in situations like that which followed       the 1987 stock market crash, satisfy increased needs for       liquidity that otherwise could feed cumulative, self-reinforcing,       contractions across many financial markets.But guarding against systemic problems also has       involved, on very rare occasions, an element of more overt risk-       sharing, in which the government--or more accurately the       taxpayer--is potentially asked to bear some of the cost of       failure.  Activating such risk sharing quite appropriately occurs       at most maybe two or three times a century.  The willingness to       do so arises from society's judgment that some bank failures may       have serious adverse effects on the entire economy and that       requiring banks to carry enough capital to avoid any risk of       failure under any circumstances itself would have unacceptable       costs in terms of reduced intermediation.If banks had to absorb all financial risk, then the       degree to which they could leverage, of necessity, would be       limited, and their contribution to economic growth, modest.       Risk-sharing encourages leverage and intermediation.  Eliminating       risk-sharing and asking banks to remove the possibility of       failure would lead to a much smaller banking system.  To attract,       or at least retain equity capital, a private financial       institution must earn at a minimum the overall economy's rate of       return, adjusted for risk.  The rate of return banks would need       in order to compete for a large amount of extra equity capital       would seriously constrain the assets they could hold.  In their       management of market or credit risk, well-run banks  carefully       consider potential losses from most possible market outcomes, and       they hold sufficient capital to protect themselves from all but       the most extreme situations.  But banks and other private       businesses recognize that to be safe against all possible risks       implies a level of capital on which it would be difficult, if not       impossible, to earn a competitive rate of return.On the other hand, if central banks or governments       effectively insulate private institutions from the largest       potential losses, however incurred, increased laxity could be       costly to society as well.  Leverage would escalate to the outer       edge of prudence, if not beyond.  Lenders to banks (as well as       their owners or managers) would learn to anticipate central bank       or government intervention and would become less responsible,       perhaps reckless, in their practices.  Such laxity would hold the       potential of a major call on taxpayers.  And central banks would       risk inflationary instabilities from excess money creation if       they acted too readily and too often to head off possible market       turmoil.In practice, the policy choice of how much, if any, of       the extreme market risk that government authorities should absorb       is fraught with many complexities.  Yet we central bankers make       this decision every day, either explicitly or by default.       Moreover, we can never know for sure whether the decisions we       made were appropriate.  The question, though, is not whether our       actions to support entire financial systems or to require major       changes at specific institutions are seen to have been necessary       in retrospect.  The absence of a fire does not mean that we       should not have paid for fire insurance.  Rather, the question is       whether, ex ante, the probability of a systemic collapse was       sufficient to warrant intervention.  Often, we cannot wait to see       whether, in hindsight, the problem will be judged to have been an       isolated event and largely benign.Supervisory Approach                  Thus, governments have been given certain       responsibilities related to their banking and financial systems       that must be balanced.  We have the responsibility to prevent       major financial market disruptions through development and       enforcement of prudent regulatory standards and, if necessary in       rare circum- stances, through direct intervention in market       events.  But we also have the responsibility to assure that       private sector institutions have the capacity to take prudent and       appropriate risks, even though such risks will sometimes result       in bank losses or even bank failures.Providing institutions with the flexibility that may       lead to failure is as important as permitting them the       opportunity to succeed.  By its nature, all business investment       is risky.  The role of banks to assist in the financing of       such risk thus implies the taking of risk by the bank itself.       Indeed, this is the economic role of banking in a market economy.       The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk, but to       manage it in a prudent manner.Our goal as supervisors, therefore, should not be to       prevent all bank failures, but to maintain sufficient prudential       standards so that banking problems do not become widespread.  We       try to achieve the proper balance through official regulations,       formal and informal supervisory policies and procedures.To some extent, we do this over time by signalling to       the market, through our actions, the kinds of circumstances in       which we might be willing to inter- vene to quell financial       turmoil, and conversely, what levels of difficulties we expect       private institutions to resolve by themselves.  The market, then,       responds by adjusting the cost of capital to banks.  Throughout       most of this century, we have made our decisions largely in a       domestic context.  However, in recent decades that situation has       changed markedly for many countries and is rapidly changing for       all.With financial instruments and markets becoming more       complex and closely linked, it is essential that bank supervisors       around the globe get to know and trust one another and       communicate openly, as necessary, when banking problems and       potential crises emerge.  In recognition of such common       interests, major industrial countries have worked together for       years through the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision.       Conferences like this one also clearly help advance the goal of       interaction.  International coordinating and educational efforts       doubtless also help supervisors cope with the growing complexity       of supervisory matters by providing them with a forum for dealing       with issues of mutual interest and concern.  The Caribbean       Banking Supervisors Group, the SEANZA Forum of Banking       Supervisors, and other regional associations of bank supervisors       in the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere help to move us in the       right direction.We have also made--and continue to make--significant       progress in developing prudent international supervisory       standards that are both quantitative and qualitative in nature.       Bill Taylor played a critical role in crafting and negotiating       the Basle Accord of 1988 for credit risk that helped greatly to       strengthen capital standards worldwide and to provide a more       equitable basis for international competition.  More recently,       the internal models approach for measuring market risks in       trading activities, adopted by the Basle Committee late last       year, builds upon that framework and may illustrate how       supervisory rules and practices can evolve.As financial markets change, supervision must be       prepared to adjust.  We have to adapt continuously to changing       technologies, changing bank practices and changing market forces.       Supervision is an ever evolving process.  We must be careful,       however, not to alter our modalities too often for fear of       creating supervisory uncertainty.  To maintain a proper balance       in the years ahead will be one of our greatest challenges.The decision to craft a bank's capital requirements for       trading activities around accepted and verifiable internal risk       measures was an important step in the supervision and regulation       of large, internationally active banks.  It is all the more       noteworthy because it recognizes the importance of both       quantitative and qualitative criteria in the measurement and       management of trading risks.  As risk management techniques       evolve for other bank activities, supervisors will need to       understand the new procedures and how they affect overall banking       risks.Time and again, though, events are demonstrating that       despite the complexity of transactions and the alleged       sophistication of management systems, it is poor qualitative       factors--that is, the lack of basic policies and controls--that       so often undermine banks.  Fortunately, in many cases, the       technology that has enabled institutions to design complex new       products also provides the techniques with which the resulting       risks can be identified, measured, and controlled.  Management       also must have the knowledge and motivation to employ these       techniques to ensure that the risks are adequately contained.  We       must never forget that no matter how technologically complex our       supervisory systems become, the basic unit of supervision on       which all else rests remains the human judgment of the degree of       risk on a specific loan, based on the creditworthiness and       character of a borrower.  If those credit judgments are       persistently flawed, no degree of complexity of supposed risk       dispersion or elegance of credit models will help.As the Barings and other episodes illustrate, proper       controls include such basic elements as adequate management       oversight and separation of duties.  Those of us who supervise       banks with worldwide operations must recognize that, with today's       telecommunications, management must extend its policies,       procedures, and controls to all offices that have the ability to       take risks.  In this respect, coordination and cooperation       between home and host countries become not only important, but       essential in maintaining financially sound institutions and       financial markets.Within the United States, the Federal Reserve and other       bank supervisors are placing growing importance on a bank's risk       management process and are strengthening our supervisory       procedures, where necessary, to assist examiners in identifying       management weaknesses and strengths.  We are also working to       develop supervisory tools and techniques that utilize available       technology and that help supervisors perform their duties with       less disruption to banks.  These improvements range from software       designed to download data about a bank's loan portfolio to an       examiner's personal computer, to simply more thoughtful reviews       of internal management reports.  Such automation enhancements       will permit examiners, themselves, to analyze more efficiently       the various concentrations within loan or investment portfolios       and, therefore, help them to identify the underlying risks and       discuss those risks with bank management.Countries in which supervisors conduct on-site       examinations or otherwise review specific loans or loan       portfolios may find such technology particularly useful.  Within       the United States, the growing volume and complexity of       transactions, particularly at the largest institutions, is       requiring such productivity enhancements and other modifications       to our supervisory procedures.  For example, rather than       evaluate a high percentage of a bank's loans and investment       products by reviewing individual transactions, we will       increasingly seek to ensure that the management process itself is       sound, and that adequate policies and controls exist.  While       still important, the amount of transaction testing, especially at       large banks, will decline.However, supervisors everywhere should expect bank       boards of directors and senior managements to perform their       leadership and oversight roles.  By themselves supervisors cannot       expect to detect or prevent every unsound practice, nor to ensure       that all weak management processes are improved.  We can expect       our banking systems to be sound only by ensuring that directors       and managers provide guidance regarding their appetite for risk;       that they bring to the bank, personnel with the integrity and       skills to do the job; and that they monitor compliance with their       own directives.Encouraging and promoting sound qualitative risk       management and internal controls has been and should remain a       high priority of bank supervisors. Indeed, it is as important, in       my view, as the development of quantitative prudential standards.Conclusion           Thus, despite all the changes and innovations, commercial       banking remains a business largely of extending credit and       managing the related risks.  To prosper, bankers must be risk-       takers, but risk-takers to an appropriate degree.  Banking is       special in all of our countries because of its role in financial       intermediation.  Accordingly, the industry has been given       important privileges, including the direct or implicit support of       a national safety net in most countries that effectively protects       it from the most severe economic events.  If relied on too       heavily, however, that safety net can be abused by banks, which       then become undercapitalized and too willing to take on       inappropriate risk.In the decades ahead, supervisors will have to adjust       to growing technologies and increasingly sophisticated markets.       A generation ago a month-old bank balance sheet was a reasonable       approximation of the current state of an institution.  Today, for       some banks, day-old balance sheets are on the edge of       obsolescence.  In the 21st century that will be true of most       banks.Future supervision will of necessity have to rely far       more on a bank's risk management information system to protect       against loss.  We supervisors will be appreciably more involved       in evaluating individual bank risk management processes, than       after-the-fact results.  In doing so, however, we must be assured       that with rare and circumscribed exceptions we do not substitute       supervisory judgments for management decisions.  That is the road       to moral hazard and inefficient bank management.  Fortunately,       the same technology and innovation that is driving supervisors to       focus on management processes will, through the development of       sophisticated market structures and responses, do much of our job       of ensuring safety and soundness.  We should be careful not to       impede the process.Bank supervisors play an important role in encouraging       the proper balance of risk-taking by developing prudent standards       and enforcing sound practices at banks.  Bill Taylor understood       that role and worked vigorously to address the weaknesses he saw.       The approach we take will convey our views regarding to what       extent governments will share banking risks and how much       responsibility rests with banks.  In a global financial system,       the choices we make will clearly have widespread effects.Return to top1996 Speeches     Home | News and events  Accessibility | Contact Us  Last update: July 23, 1996 12:00 PM\n"
